"""Data models for the BMAD workflow compiler.

This module defines the core data structures used throughout the compiler:
- StepIR: Intermediate representation of a tri-modal step file
- WorkflowIR: Intermediate representation of parsed workflow
- CompiledWorkflow: Final compiled output ready for LLM consumption
- CompilerContext: Context passed to workflow-specific compilers
- WorkflowSource: Layout-aware discovery result (skill_id + layout + path)

class WorkflowSource:
    """Result of layout-aware workflow discovery.

    Carries the canonical workflow / skill identifier alongside the
    layout flavour that produced the resolution and the absolute path
    to the resolved directory. Callers that only need the path can
    treat this like a thin wrapper, but the extra fields are useful
    for logging, telemetry, and downstream branch decisions.

    Attributes:
        workflow_name: Logical workflow id used by callers (e.g.
            ``"create-story"``, ``"testarch-atdd"``). Preserved verbatim
            even when the underlying skill id differs (the new layout
            stores ``"testarch-atdd"`` under ``bmad-testarch-atdd``).
        skill_id: ``bmad-`` prefixed skill id when the source is a
            v6.4+ skill (e.g. ``"bmad-create-story"``). For legacy or
            bundled-only workflows this is ``None``.
        layout: Discovery layout — ``"new"`` for a v6.4+ skill match,
            ``"old"`` for a legacy ``_bmad/...`` match, ``"bundled"``
            when only the bundled fallback shipped with bmad-assist
            could satisfy the request, or ``"override"`` for the
            project-level ``.bmad-assist/workflows/<name>/`` override.
        path: Absolute path to the resolved workflow directory.
